**Jenkins pipelines**, particularly **Declarative** and **Scripted** pipelines, in a simpler way.

### **What is a Jenkins Pipeline?**

A **Jenkins Pipeline** is a set of steps that automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code. Think of it like a flowchart of actions that need to happen every time you want to make sure your code works and gets deployed. Jenkins pipelines are written as code, usually in a file called a **Jenkinsfile**.

There are **two types** of Jenkins Pipelines:
1. **Declarative Pipeline** (simpler and structured).
2. **Scripted Pipeline** (more flexible but complex).

### **Declarative Pipeline**

#### **What is it?**
- **Declarative Pipeline** is a **simpler** and more **structured** way of writing Jenkins pipelines. It has a clear and predefined format, making it easier for people to understand and write.

#### **How does it look?**
- A **Declarative Pipeline** uses blocks like `pipeline`, `agent`, and `stages`. Each stage defines a step (e.g., building, testing, or deploying the code).
- It looks more like a recipe or set of instructions.

#### **Example**:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any        // Run this pipeline on any available Jenkins agent
    stages {         // Define the stages
        stage('Build') {       // The first stage: Build
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {        // The second stage: Test
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {      // The third stage: Deploy
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Key Points**:
- **Agent**: Defines where the pipeline will run (`any` means any available machine).
- **Stages**: This is where the pipeline does the actual work. For example, `Build`, `Test`, and `Deploy` are different stages.
- **Steps**: Each stage has steps that tell Jenkins what to do (e.g., print messages, run tests).

#### **Use Case**:
- **When to use Declarative Pipelines**:
  - **Simple workflows** like building, testing, and deploying an application.
  - When you want **structure** and don’t need too much custom logic.
  
- **Real-World Example**:
  - A small web application that goes through a basic `build`, `test`, and `deploy` process. You want to automate the process each time someone pushes new code to the repository.

### **Scripted Pipeline**

#### **What is it?**
- **Scripted Pipeline** is more **powerful** and **flexible**. It allows you to write more complex logic, like if-else conditions or loops.
- It’s written using **Groovy**, a programming language, which gives you more control but also makes it harder to write.

#### **How does it look?**
- A **Scripted Pipeline** doesn’t have a strict structure. It’s more like writing a script with full control over what happens at each step.

#### **Example**:

```groovy
node {     // 'node' tells Jenkins to run the pipeline on a specific machine or agent
    stage('Build') {    // First stage: Build
        echo 'Building the application...'
    }
    stage('Test') {     // Second stage: Test
        echo 'Running tests...'
    }
    if (currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') {   // Custom logic: Check if the build was successful
        stage('Deploy') {   // Third stage: Deploy
            echo 'Deploying the application...'
        }
    } else {
        echo 'Skipping deployment due to failed build...'
    }
}
```

#### **Key Points**:
- **node**: Defines where the pipeline should run (on which machine/agent).
- **Custom Logic**: Scripted pipelines allow for custom conditions like `if` statements, loops, and error handling.
- **Flexibility**: You can define any kind of logic, making it suitable for more complex workflows.

#### **Use Case**:
- **When to use Scripted Pipelines**:
  - **Complex workflows** that require conditional steps, custom error handling, or dynamic behavior.
  - When you need full control over how the pipeline behaves.
  
- **Real-World Example**:
  - A larger project that involves multiple steps, like checking if tests pass, running different deployment scenarios, or integrating with multiple services based on conditions.

### **Comparison of Declarative and Scripted Pipelines**

| Feature                 | Declarative Pipeline             | Scripted Pipeline          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Simplicity**           | Simple and easier to understand  | More complex, requires Groovy knowledge |
| **Structure**            | Predefined structure (pipeline, stages, steps) | Free-form, can write any logic |
| **Error Handling**       | Built-in error handling          | Custom error handling needed |
| **Custom Logic**         | Limited (basic logic)            | Full flexibility for custom logic |
| **When to Use**          | Simple CI/CD workflows           | Complex, conditional workflows |

### **Is Groovy the Only Way to Write Jenkins Pipelines?**

Yes, **Groovy** is the underlying language for writing Jenkins pipelines. However, in **Declarative Pipeline**, you don't need to know much Groovy. It provides a more human-readable syntax, making it easier to write without deep knowledge of Groovy.

For **Scripted Pipelines**, you’ll need to know Groovy because it involves more complex scripting.

### **Real-World Use Cases of Jenkins Pipelines**

1. **Simple Web Application (Declarative Pipeline)**:
   - A small application that needs to go through basic stages like **build**, **test**, and **deploy**.
   - You would use a **Declarative Pipeline** because it’s easy to write and covers the basic steps.
   
   Example:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm install'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm test'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   echo 'Deploying to production...'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Complex Microservice Deployment (Scripted Pipeline)**:
   - A complex system with multiple microservices that need to be tested and deployed depending on various conditions.
   - You’d use a **Scripted Pipeline** because you need conditional logic to check which services passed the test and which should be deployed.

   Example:
   ```groovy
   node {
       stage('Build') {
           sh 'mvn clean install'
       }
       stage('Test') {
           sh 'mvn test'
       }
       if (currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') {
           stage('Deploy to Production') {
               sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
           }
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **In Summary:**
- **Declarative Pipelines**: Easier to write and understand. Ideal for simple, straightforward pipelines.
- **Scripted Pipelines**: More complex but offers greater flexibility. Ideal for advanced use cases with conditional logic.

Both types use **Groovy** under the hood, but Declarative pipelines require much less Groovy knowledge, making them more accessible.
