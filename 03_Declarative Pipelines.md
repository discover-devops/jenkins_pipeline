**Declarative Pipelines** in Jenkins are written in **Groovy**, just like Scripted Pipelines. However, the syntax for Declarative Pipelines is much simpler, more structured, and human-readable compared to the fully scriptable nature of Scripted Pipelines.

Even though Declarative Pipelines are written in Groovy, you donâ€™t need deep knowledge of Groovy to use them. The Declarative Pipeline syntax is designed to be beginner-friendly, with predefined blocks like `pipeline`, `agent`, `stages`, `steps`, and `post`.

### Example of Declarative Pipeline (written in Groovy):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Groovy Language**: Declarative Pipeline is still based on Groovy, but the syntax is simplified to make pipeline definitions easier and more structured.
- **Structured Blocks**: It uses blocks like `pipeline`, `agent`, `stages`, and `steps` to organize the pipeline in a more readable format, even though it's Groovy code under the hood.

Declarative Pipeline is easier to use and designed for most common CI/CD workflows without needing to dive deep into Groovy programming.
